title: google your brain

Last year I attended the yearly <a href="http://thewcdc.net/">warm crocodile developer conference</a>, where I enjoyed a talk by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>. He showcased some new Azure manage and deployment tools. Whatever.
But he also made some funny comments about bloging.
Even though more and more developer profiles are putting their ideas, opinions and experiences out on the internet, I have always found those blogs only for devs with a lot of experience, skills and for the selected few.

In Hanselmans talk he used his own blog to show some new stuff. *"Everyone should have a blog. You can always google your brain later"*, he said.

Cool argument. So this is what I'm going to do.
