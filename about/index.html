<p>
Some would say, I'm a passionate software developer. This is not true.
</p>
<p>I would say that I am a nerd. I mean, if you cannot be a nerd at what you do, what's the point?</p>

<p>
Living with my girlfriend in downtown Copenhagen, I'm currently employed at <a href="http://www.e-conomic.com/">e-conomic international</a>, developing tomorrows ERP systems. Here, I meet obstacles and challenges every day, and learning from the best.
My experience is growing every second, and I have the possibility to explore new areas of software engineering with great pleasure. I love to explore and learn new   technologies and tools, and are also very good at it.
</p>

<p>My primary focus have always been back-end oriented, due to the fact that I am a pre-internet child. But as javascript begin to color my everyday, I tend to do more and more front-end. The apps I am working today have almost the same amount of complexity like the tradition "back-ended" tecknologies like a .NET app. But who's to label things? When it all come down to it, I'm really just a full-stack developer doing what I love.</p>

<p>
In my sparetime I also offer my services on a more freelance basis. I have i.e. specialized in Silverlight web applications and the Microsoft Azure Platform, converting these into html5, among other things.
</p>

<h4>Some touch-points of experience:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>.NET C#</li>
	<li>ASP.NET (+MVC)</li>
	<li>ASP</li>
	<li>Javascript in all sorts and shapes including cut-edge lib's like React (love that!)</li>
	<li>All kinds of scripting languages like bash, regular shell and PowerShell (awesome)</li>
	<li>(MS)SQL</li>
	<li>Visual Studio (Love it/Hate it)</li>
	<li>WPF, SilverLight</li>
	<li>HTML, CSS and other front-end stuff</li>
	<li>Git, TeamCity, Jira</li>
	<li>Microsoft Azure, Setup, Management & Deployment</li>
	<li>Continuous Integration and Agile Development methods like SCRUM & Kanban</li>
</ul>

<h4>When developing and working on new ideas I write my code with a focus on:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Readabillity</li>
	<li>Maintainability</li>
	<li>Testability</li>
	<li>Automation</li>
</ul>
<p>
.. in that order

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
In 2013, I graduated from the <a href="www.dtu.dk">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a> with a bachelor degree in engineering in Information Technology.

At DTU I have gained lots of experience with working in groups, learned about agile software development methods and gained skills and a broad overview of the various layers in Computer Science and techniques in software engineering.
</p>

<p>
My elective courses have been in the more pratical levels/layers of Computer Science, for instance with courses in various programming courses for Java, C and C#. My education has also provided me with skills and overview of the lower levels of CS (for example interplay between hardware and software, Digital technique and compilers, operating systems)
