Some would say, I'm a passionate software developer. This is not true.
</p>
<p>I would say that I am a nerd. I mean, if you cannot be a nerd at what you do, what's the point?</p>

<p>
Living with my girlfriend in downtown Copenhagen, I'm currently employed at <a href="http://www.e-conomic.com/">e-conomic international</a>, developing tomorrows ERP systems. Here, I meet obstacles and challenges every day, and learning from the best.
My experience is growing every second, and I have the possibility to explore new areas of software engineering with great pleasure. I love to explore and learn new   technologies and tools, and are also very good at it.
</p>

<p>My primary focus has always been back-end oriented, due to the fact that I am a pre-internet child. But as javascript begin to color my everyday, I tend to do more and more front-end. But who's to label things? When it all comes down, I'm really working as a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>
In my sparetime I also offer my services on a more freelance basis. I have i.e. specialized in Silverlight web applications and the Microsoft Azure Platform, converting these into html5, among other things.
</p>

I have a large experience with technologies/languages/proceses like:
<ul>
	<li>.NET C#</li>
	<li>ASP.NET (+MVC)</li>
	<li>ASP</li>
	<li>Javascript</li>
	<li>(MS)SQL</li>
	<li>Visual Studio</li>
	<li>WPF, SilverLight</li>
	<li>Nunit, Specflow, Resharper</li>
	<li>HTML, CSS</li>
	<li>Git, TeamCity, Jira</li>
	<li>Continuous Integration</li>
	<li>Microsoft Azure, Setup, Management & Deployment</li>
	<li>Agile Development like SCRUM</li>
</ul>


When developing, I write my code with a focus on:
<ul>
	<li>Readabillity</li>
	<li>Maintainability</li>
	<li>Testability</li>
	<li>Automation</li>
</ul>

In 2013, I graduated from the <a href="www.dtu.dk">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a> with a bachelor degree in engineering in Information Technology.

At DTU I have gained lots of experience with working in groups, learned about agile software development methods and gained skills and a broad overview of the various layers in Computer Science and techniques in software engineering.

My elective courses have been in the more pratical levels/layers of Computer Science, for instance with courses in various programming courses for Java, C and C#. My education has also provided me with skills and overview of the lower levels of CS (for example interplay between hardware and software, Digital technique and compilers, operating systems)
